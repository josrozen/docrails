h2. Active Support Overview

Active Support is the Rails component responsible for providing Ruby language extensions, utilities, and other transversal stuff. It offers a richer bottom-line at the language level, targeted both at the development of Rails applications, and at the development of Rails itself.

By referring to this guide you will learn:

* The extensions to the Ruby core modules and classes provided by Rails.
* The rest of fundamental libraries available in Rails.
